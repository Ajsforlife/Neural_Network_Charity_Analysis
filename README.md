# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose

The purpose of this Analysis is to determine which non profit foundations will be successful if given donations and if that money is used efficiently. The data will be preprocessed and then compiled trained and evaluated and then we run 3 test optimizations attempting to target higher accuracy. We thoroughly preprocess the data to make the models run smoothly before evaluation.

## Summary
### Overall Summary

### Recommendation

    Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.
        Data Preprocessing
            What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
            What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
            What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
        Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
            How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
            Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
            What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

    Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
